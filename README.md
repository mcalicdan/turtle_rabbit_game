turtle_rabbit_game
==================

turtle rabbit game_objects

For this game I added "this.time" = this. distraction/ this. speed to determine both animal's times.  

I determined the speed and distraction for both animals (making sure that the turtle's properties would ensure it would win.  

I added if/then statments to compare their times and to announce the winner.
